=============================================
Main Project Site:  http://fluidproject.org
Documentation:      http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Documentation


What's New in 1.4-SNAPSHOT?
===========================

    * FSS fixes and improvements
    * UI Options redesign
    * jQuery UI library updated to 1.8.12
    * jQuery UI accordion widget is no longer a dependency and will not be included in your bundle

What's in this Release?
=======================

This release is (will be) available in two ways:

    1) Create your own custom build, using the new Infusion Builder
           http://builder.fluidproject.org
    
    2) Alternatively, you can download a source code release from Github:
           https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion
       (this will include our tests)
    
If you use the Infusion Builder, your download will include at the top level a single JavaScript file,
    MyInfusion.js
which is a combination of all requested source files. Developers can include this single file in 
their pages to provide all the necessary support for the Infusion component Library. You can elect
to have this file minified (for a production environment) or not (for development).

Demo Portal
-----------
The bundle now comes with a convenient one-stop-shop for seeing all components in action. You can
find the demo portal in the "demos" folder in the release bundle or on our Website at:

    http://fluidproject.org/products/infusion/infusion-demos/

When run from a local file system, several of these demos require you to enable local file AJAX 
if you're using Firefox 3 and higher. Here's more information:

Please note that the tests in the "manual-tests" folder are deprecated, and are being
converted into unit tests. Any remaining tests in that folder may not function properly.

The documentation for Infusion consists of a number of information pages stored in the Fluid Wiki.
The pages include tutorials, API descriptions, testing procedures, and data-gathering approaches. To make the 
manual pages easy to navigate, we have added the following guides:

      bar with the name "Infusion Documentation".

Known Issues
============

The Fluid Project uses a JIRA website to track bugs: http://issues.fluidproject.org
Some of the known issues in this release are described here:

FSS:
    FLUID-2504: Flexible columns don't maintain proper alignment under certain conditions
    FLUID-2434: In IE, major font size changes break text positioning within form controls

Framework:
    FLUID-2577: Renderer performance can be slow on IE 6 and 7 in some contexts.

Inline Edit: 
    FLUID-3632: Chrome 4 in WIN XP does not allow tabbing out of tinyMCE editor's edit field
    FLUID-3811: Previous edits are persisting in Edit Mode despite demo being reloaded in IE8
    FLUID-1600: Pressing the "Tab" key to exit edit mode places focus on the wrong item

Layout Reorderer: 
    FLUID-3864: Layout Reorderer failed to move portlets back to the first column in three-columns view with keyboard
    FLUID-3089: If columns become stacked, can't drag item into lower column
    FLUID-858:  Portlet Columns load with no padding between them in IE7

Pager:
    FLUID-4036: The Pager is dependent on the use of rsf:ids for sortable columns
    FLUID-2880: The Pager will be refactored. Note that as a result of this, there will be significant changes to the Pager API
    FLUID-3584: Clicking page numbers throws an error: using IE 6

Renderer: 
    FLUID-3493: Renderer appears to corrupt templates containing empty tags on Opera (maybe others)
    FLUID-3277: Attempt to add children to leaf component in tree results in "targetlump is undefined" error
    FLUID-3276: Enclosing branch nodes within markup which has "headers" attribute causes them to become invisible to the renderer

Reorderer: 
    FLUID-118:  Dragging an image offscreen or out of the frame has some unexpected results.

UI Options: 
    FLUID-3621: The text in buttons does not change size.
    FLUID-2398: Minimum font size control changes the text size even when the base size is larger then the minimum.
    
Uploader: 
    FLUID-3886: The HTML5 version of the Uploader can't exclude certain files based on file type
    FLUID-3996: Deleting files on the local filesystem after they have been added to the Uploader's queue will cause inconsistent behaviour
    FLUID-3997: Can't tab to the "Browse/Add More" button with the keyboard in IE with Flash 10
    FLUID-3999: "Add more" button is not disabled while uploading other files in HTML5-compliant browsers
    FLUID-2052: Cannot tab away from the "Browse Files" button with Flash 10*
    * For information related to known issues with Flash 10 compatibility,
