# Minimal Footprint - Preferences Framework

This folder provides an example of using the preferences framework with a minimal resource footprint. While it is
preferable to use the Separated Panel version, which provides a preference editor on each page, this approach
illustrates how to improve page load performance. It has the following features:

- uses the grade version of a Full Page prefs editor
- lazy loads the UI Enhancer

This code is the basis for the
[Minimal Footprint - Preferences Framework tutorial](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-prefsFrameworkMinimalFootprint/MinimalFootprint.html).
