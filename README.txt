What Is Infusion?
=================
Infusion is a different kind of JavaScript framework. Built for creating applications that are
highly usable and accessible, Infusion provides a rich set of APIs for creating loosely-coupled
models and views using a declarative and event-driven style.

Infusion includes:
    * an application framework for developing applications with JavaScript and jQuery,
    * a growing collection of user interface components, and
    * a modular CSS framework that allows you to add, remove and mix classes to get effect you want.

Infusion embraces unobtrusive, functional techniques that promote less code and greater flexibility.
Infusion takes the pain out of developing accessible, high performance, clean and nimble front-ends
for applications that want to do more. Our approach is to leave you in control - it's your
interface, using your markup, your way.
