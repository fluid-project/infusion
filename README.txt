What Is Infusion?
=================
Infusion is a different kind of JavaScript framework. Our approach is to leave you in control â€“ 
it's your interface, using your markup, your way. Infusion is accessible and very, very configurable.

Infusion includes:
    * an application framework for developing flexible interfaces with JavaScript and jQuery,
    * a growing collection of user interface components, and
    * a lightweight CSS framework.


Where Can I See Infusion Components?
====================================

We have a convenient, one-stop-shop for seeing all our components in action:
